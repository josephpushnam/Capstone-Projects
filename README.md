# Capstone Projects Repository  
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository showcases the capstone projects from my Master's in Business Analytics program at the **University of Utah**.

## About Me  
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Joseph Pushnam**, a Business Analytics student with a passion for solving complex problems through data-driven insights. This repository highlights my work on the **Home Credit Default Risk Project**, where I explore predictive modeling techniques to address real-world business challenges.

## Featured Project: **Home Credit Default Risk**  

### **Business Problem and Project Objective**  
The project focuses on predicting client loan repayment ability using alternative data. This enables financial institutions to:
- Improve their credit risk assessment processes.
- Expand financial inclusion to underserved populations by identifying clients with strong repayment potential.

---

### **Group's Solution to the Business Problem**  
Our team developed a robust machine learning pipeline to analyze the provided datasets. Key components of our solution included:
- **Data preprocessing**: Addressing missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
- **Model selection**: Using Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) for its superior performance on tabular datasets.
- **Evaluation**: Achieving an AUC of 0.75 on the test dataset, demonstrating the modelâ€™s effectiveness.

---

### **My Contributions to the Project**  
As an individual contributor to this project, I focused on:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted detailed analysis to understand key drivers of loan defaults.
   - Visualized relationships between features like income type, credit type, and repayment status.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features like `bureau_balance_ratio` to enhance predictive power.
   - Engineered temporal features from historical application data.
3. **Model Optimization**:
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning on the XGBoost model using Grid Search.
   - Evaluated model performance through cross-validation.

### **Business Value of the Solution**  
The developed model provides financial institutions with a reliable tool to assess credit risk. Key benefits include:
- **Improved decision-making**: Reduce default rates by identifying high-risk clients more effectively.
- **Broader financial inclusion**: Extend credit to more customers while minimizing financial risk.

---

### **Challenges Encountered**  
- **Handling Missing Data**: Several features had high percentages of missing values, requiring thoughtful imputation strategies.  
- **Feature Selection**: Balancing the inclusion of informative features without overfitting the model.  
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that all analysis steps were clearly documented and could be replicated by other team members.

---

### **What I Learned**  
Through this project, I gained valuable skills, including:
- Using `tidyverse` in R for advanced data manipulation and visualization.  
- Building and optimizing machine learning models like XGBoost.  
- Communicating complex findings effectively through clear visualizations and narratives.
